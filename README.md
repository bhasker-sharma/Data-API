# Data-API

I have to fulfill this thing :-
     -> There is the python scrip that will get the continous data from sensor and convert that data in the batches of files (DATA Speed :- 100 data-points/sec)  

  Now i have to make the particular web app which should have the API with following functionalities:-
       -> Handel the data from that script and convert it into .csv files.  (1st API)
       -> Upload that files to the FTP server one by one. (2nd API)
       -> then at last i need to send that data to web app  in json where graph will be ploted and displayed.

  *** Remember that all this is real time DATA that is comming continously at above mentioned speed so we need to handel  Data as it is.
